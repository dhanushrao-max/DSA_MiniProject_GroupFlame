# DSA_MiniProject_GroupFlame
Design a file compression program implementing the Huffman coding algorithm to compress and decompress files losslessly. The system should build optimal binary encoding trees based on character frequencies and use them to encode/decode data, potentially reducing file size by 30-50% or more.
